        BD working closely with Product to achieve Product-related goals, which (not surprisingly) are about improving the product and/or accelerating the product development process.  Possible structures include:
        <br></br>

        Marketplace – in this model, the company’s BD team creates and manages a program that allows 3rd-party developers to build applications that integrate with the company’s core product / platform.  While the company can benefit in a couple of ways from such a program, the Product team benefits by offloading some of their work to partners.  For example, Salesforce (which has built the poster-child for a successful marketplace) has off-loaded the development work in several product areas to partners (like DocuSign and EchoSign for contract management).  athenahealth’s BD team created (skip to 4:45) their apps marketplace because they wanted to reduce the burden on the company’s Product team.

        Integration – in this scenario, the company’s business model is predicated on having the company’s product integrate with 3rd-parties.  The BD team works with Product to identify potential partners and then close and manage these relationships.  Examples of this include analytics companies (like InsightSquared), data integration companies (like Bedrock Data) and Ad-tech companies (like DataXu).
