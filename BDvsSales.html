    <title>BizDev is not Sales</title>

      <p>I define “Sales” as the function at the company that is responsible for selling the company’s products to end customers in exchange for money.  Sales people are in direct contact with potential customers (new sales) and/or current customers (renewals, upgrades, and cross-sells). <br></br>


In the past few years, many Sales people stopped referring to themselves as “Sales” and started to refer to themselves as “Business Development” instead.  I assume they made this change because they think that the term “Sales” has some negative connotations, while the term “Business Development” is more neutral and therefore preferable.  Whatever the reason, this has created lots of confusion around the term “Business Development”.  For example, most job specs for what are clearly Sales roles use the term Business Development in their title.<br></br>

As I will explain, Business Development is not Sales, as the BD function is not responsible for selling the company’s products to end customers.  (Just to be clear, I am not saying that BD does not overlap with Sales.  In many instances, BD works closely with Sales.  And in one instance – specifically when the company sells via the channel – Business Development can be part of Sales.)<br></br>
